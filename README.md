### Directory Depth Generator
This command will execute, display the table on the console, sort the results by depth, and then save the sorted result to the specified CSV file.
Replace `C:\Your\Target\Directory` with the path to the directory you want to analyze, and `C:\Path\To\Output\File.csv` with the desired path and filename for the CSV file. The Sort-Object cmdlet is used to sort the results by the "Depth" property in ascending order, and Export-Csv is used to save the results to a CSV file.
